This analytical report aims to segment clients' data by their annual income. Once clusterd, we can compare the relation between each cluster and each variable in order to conduct a precise customer analysis. <br>

Variables of dataset: <br>
*  Income: annual household income of the client<br>
*  Amount for each product category over the last 2 years<br>
*  Number of purchases made for each channel and with discount<br>


Statistical methods applied in this report: <br>
* Principal component analysis <br>
* K-means <br>
* Test anova<br>
* Test KÂ²<br>
